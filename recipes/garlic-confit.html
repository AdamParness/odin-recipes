<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    Garlic confit transforms ordinary garlic cloves into a gourmet condiment.
    This would go great with potatoes, cooked veggies, pasta, or on a piece of toast!
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Two Bulbs of Garlic</li>
    <li>Three Quarters of a Cup of Olive Oil</li>
    <li>Two Sprigs of Thyme</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        Cut tops off garlic bulbs. Place bulbs on a clean working surface; press down 
        firmly on bulbs with the flat part of a large knife to separate cloves. 
        Remove and discard skins.
    </li>
    <li>
        Pour oil into a very small pot; add garlic cloves and thyme. Cook over 
        medium heat until bubbles start to form. Reduce the heat to the lowest 
        possible setting, and cook until garlic is soft but not brown, 20 to 
        25 minutes, depending on the size of the cloves. Let cool to room 
        temperature, 15 to 30 minutes.
    </li>
    <li>
        Transfer mixture to a sterilized jar, then seal and refrigerate.
    </li>
</ol>
